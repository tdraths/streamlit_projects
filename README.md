# Streamlit Projects Repository

This repository houses the various Streamlit projects I built using the video series from [DataProfessor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q) hosted on the [FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

They are simple apps, both in code and in predictiability/analysis, and are simply a first crack at building simple apps that can be deployed using Heroku, Streamlit or other services.
